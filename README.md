📊🚀 Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning Models 🚫📱
Classifying SMS Messages with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest

🔍 Overview
In today’s digital age, unsolicited spam messages are a growing nuisance, leading to privacy concerns and productivity loss. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). Using the popular SMS Spam Collection dataset, this project implements and compares three powerful models:

🔍 Naive Bayes – Efficient for text classification with high accuracy.
⚖️ Logistic Regression – Provides interpretability with robust binary classification.
🌲 Random Forest – An ensemble method providing high accuracy and generalization.
🎯 Objectives
Preprocess SMS text data using NLP techniques.
Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Implement and compare the performance of three machine learning models:
🔍 Naive Bayes
⚖️ Logistic Regression
🌲 Random Forest
Evaluate model performance using:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC Curves.
Provide a comparative analysis and recommend the best model for SMS spam detection.
📂 Dataset

⚖️ Comparative Analysis
Naive Bayes:
Strengths: Fast, efficient, and high accuracy for short text.
Weaknesses: Independence assumption can limit performance on complex datasets.
Logistic Regression:
Strengths: Good interpretability and balanced precision-recall.
Weaknesses: Assumes a linear decision boundary, which may not capture complex patterns.
Random Forest:
Strengths: High accuracy and robustness through ensemble learning.
Weaknesses: Computationally expensive and less interpretable.
🚀 Future Directions
Advanced NLP Techniques:
Implement Word2Vec, FastText, or Transformer-based models (BERT) for richer feature representations.
Deep Learning Models:
Explore LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or BiLSTM models for sequential dependencies.
Generalization Testing:
Test on other datasets (e.g., email or social media spam) for robustness.
